 		<h1>Chicken</h1>
	 	<textarea> class="col-lg-3 col-md-2 col-sm-1"> The chicken is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl. Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. </textarea>

	 	<h1>Beef</h1>
	 	<textarea></textarea> class="col-lg-3 col-md-2 col-sm-1"> Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.</textarea>
